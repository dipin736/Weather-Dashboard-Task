This is a weather forecasting web application that provides users with current weather information and a 5-day forecast. The app is built using React, and it fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API. Users can also toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit units for temperature display.

## Features:

- **Current Weather**: Displays current weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and description.
- **5-Day Forecast**: Displays the weather forecast for the next 5 days.
- **Unit Toggle**: Allows users to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit for temperature units.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
    cd weather-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
    npm install
   ```

4. Start the application:

   ```bash
    npm run dev
    
    The app will now be running on http://localhost:5173.

## API Used:
**OpenWeather API**: The app fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API.

## Approach:
For this project, I focused on building a simple and interactive user interface using React. I used the OpenWeather API to fetch current weather data and a 5-day forecast. The key functionalities include displaying weather information based on user input (city name) and switching between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The app also utilizes CSS for styling and responsive design to ensure it looks good on various devices.
